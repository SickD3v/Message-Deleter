A simple script that deletes messages on Discord using the search option. The advantage of this script is that it starts with the first message of the conversation instead of the last, preventing the other user from seeing the messages being deleted in real time. In the config.json file, there is a key called "timeout", which allows you to set the time interval between each deleted message. I recommend setting it between 2 and 5 seconds to avoid hitting rate limits.
